# MusicalChords
This repository contains my deep learning project as a beginner, focused on classifying musical chords using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify and classify different chords from audio samples.

# Key Features
Dataset: Utilizes a diverse dataset of audio recordings encompassing various chord types (Am, Bb, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G).
Preprocessing: Implements audio preprocessing techniques, including the extraction of Mel spectrograms, to convert raw audio data into a format suitable for neural network training.
Model Architecture: Employs a CNN architecture to learn and distinguish chord patterns from the spectrogram representations.
Evaluation: Includes scripts for model evaluation, assessing classification accuracy, and visualizing results.

# Usage
Dataset Preparation: Organize audio recordings into folders based on chord classes (e.g., 'Am', 'Bb', etc.) within the specified data directory.
Requirements: Install the necessary dependencies
Training: Execute the training script to train the chord classification model.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation script.

# Testing
The model with 94% accuracy has also been provided for testing.
